\section{Introduction}
%Literature intro
%A bit unclear what to write here - check with Branson
Explain what APIs are. 
Explain how and that APIs change. (Link it to the software evolution in a nice way). 


\subsection{Problem Statement}
1. 

\subsection{Purpose of the Study}
Academia: 
The results of what *actually* (i.e. our study) affects APIs could be compared to what literature says should affect design (i.e. best practices). 

Industry: 
If a company can study their API's evolution and be able to track changes and design decisions, it can give them more knowledge to further improve and develop their API. 

If companies can identify changes, they can also identify what *was* bad.



Changing APIs is usually not a good thing. If you can identify what changes APIs you can spend more time on that in development to avoid too much change in the future. 


\subsection{Research Questions}
RQ1: What drives API evolution? 
SRQ1: To what extent can we reverse engineer API change decisions?
SRQ2:
