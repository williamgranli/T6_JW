\section{Introduction}
%API Design (and a little bit of ecosystems, and a bit of problem statement)
As the software industry and the open source movement steadily grow, the number of public APIs is increasing. APIs can improve the development speed \cite{stylos2006comparing}, contribute to higher quality software \cite{stylos2006comparing} and increase the reusability of software \cite{afonso2012evaluating}.  There is a consensus in that modifying APIs generally should be avoided if possible \cite{google_talk} \cite{mcdonnell2013empirical} \cite{robbes2012developers} \cite{henning2007api} \cite{robbes2012developers} since it will require the users of the API to update the code that is accessing the API, thus causing a disruption in the software ecosystem \cite{messerschmitt2005software} that the API's platform is a part of. Most commonly, already deployed APIs are modified due to code refactoring being made \cite{dig2005role} \cite{xing2006refactoring}. 
%Software Evolution 
In the discipline of Software Evolution, such updates to software are studied from an evolutionary standpoint. Software can be updated for different reasons and these motives can be grouped into corrective, adaptive, perfective and preventive changes \cite{lientz1980software} \cite{iso}. 

%Gap in Literature
Existing studies that explore the intent behind API modifications exist \cite{hou2011exploring}. There are however no studies that attempt to map the motives behind changes to business needs or existing software evolution theories such as the four categories of maintenance \cite{lientz1980software}. The area of programming language APIs is well-explored \cite{hou2011exploring} \cite{shi2011empirical}, but few studies that explore platform APIs exist \cite{robbes2012developers}. To the best of our knowledge, no studies that explore the motives behind or the effects of API evolution have previously been performed on embedded platform APIs. 

%Purpose (and a bit of problem statement)
Because of the negative implications that modifications to to APIs cause for the API users, it is important to understand why changes to APIs happen. If most common pitfalls are known before the development of new APIs begin, these mistakes could be mitigated. Before the industry can make use of this information, we must also critically assess to what degree we trace such motives. To achieve this, we will perform a case study which aims to investigate the underlying factors behind what drives changes to APIs. This will be done by empirically analysing the changes between two versions of an API. Subsequently, the designers of the API will be interviewed and to verify (!!!does this imply that our findings will be accurate?) the results of our analysis. 

The sections following the Introduction are structured as follows: In Section II, we present a literature review on research related to our study. Section II describes the case company and how it was selected. A description of our methodology is introduced in Section III. 

\subsection{Research Questions}
\begin{itemize}
\item RQ1: What drives API evolution? 
\item RQ1.1: To what extent can we reverse engineer API change decisions?
%\item SRQ1.2: Are changes/improvements to APIs made for good reasons? (Compare why the changes were made to best practises for why you should change APIs)
\end{itemize}

\section{Case Company Description}
Mention the country, size and domain. 
Focus mostly on the API since that's what's relevant to our study. 

Also try to get some information on the users of the API. (it might be relevant).

The case was selected using convenience sampling \cite{flyvbjerg2006five}, and a maximum variation strategy was used \cite{benbasat1987case}. As such, the goal was to include as many companies as possible in this study. [Ask Richard: Do you think we can claim that our case is typical, critical, revelatory or unique? Or is our current description adequate?]


\section{Methodology}

\subsection{Research strategy and investigation methods}
• Describe and explain the research strategy and investigation methods that will be used for the project. Motivate your choice? Use relevant references.
AKA EXPLAIN WHY WE DO 


Brief intro, saying we will do a case study \cite{runeson2009guidelines} and what data collection methods will be used. 

Explain why case study was chosen i.e. cuz we look at something in it's natural environment (it wouldn't work to look at example data)

Another reason that the case study approach was chosen is that there is little existing research conducted in the area, and that input from the industry is vital to the success of the research. (Especially to validate if the proposed ``pitfalls''  are correct).

Explain why we chose case study compared to for example design research.


\subsection{Case Study Design and Planning}

not sure if we will need this as a section
*Do we create a case study protocol or is it too early?

\subsection{Summary of methodology}

• Research strategy (research methodology) 
AKA EXPLAIN HOW

The goal of the study is twofold

*Define what type of goal and explain why it is ( exploratory, descriptive, explanatory, or improving.)

*It will be an embedded case study since both the code and documentation will be used as a unit of analysis. (We can discuss if interviews will be a unit of analysis or not).



\subsection{Data Collection}
• data collection procedures (e.g. interviews? survey? and sampling?) 
The main form of data collection will be performed through code and documentation analysis (third degree aka independent). In addition to this analysis, interviews will be conducted. The main purpose of the interviews is to provide insight regarding RQ1.1, but also to support data triangulation. 

Explain how we will sample the interviewees. (Ask Imed how this will be done).


\subsection{Data Analysis}
• method for analyzing the data (grounded theory? Thematic analysis? Statistical analysis?) strategies for validating findings

How will data be analyzed?
