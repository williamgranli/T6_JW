\begin{abstract}
   The ABSTRACT is to be in fully-justified italicized text, at the top 
   of the left-hand column, below the author and affiliation 
   information. Use the word ``Abstract'' as the title, in 12-point 
   Times, boldface type, centered relative to the column, initially 
   capitalized. The abstract is to be in 10-point, single-spaced type. 
   The abstract may be up to 3 inches (7.62 cm) long. Leave two blank 
   lines after the Abstract, then begin the main text.

\Section{Introduction}
Comparisons between programming languages are difficult to perform, due to characteristical differences between languages, such as syntax. One aspect of code is its readability, which in turn is a determining factor of a piece of software's quality and maintainability \cite{aggarwal2002integrated, elshoff1982improving}. Buse \& Westley define readability as ``a property that influences how easily a given piece of code can be read and understood'' \cite{buse2010learning}. Existing studies related to the concept of code readability focus on differences between specific languages, which can be seen in \cite{buse2010learning}. Buse \& Westley introduce a metrics system for measuring the readability of code, and Java is the language of choice in the study \cite{buse2010learning}. Buse \& Westley also discuss readability and its impact on programming language design, but they do not explore the readability differences between languages \cite{buse2010learning}. Posnett et al. \cite{posnett2011simpler} have further developed Buse \& Westley's metrics model to provide a simpler and more practical model which builds on size metrics as well as Halstead metrics \cite{halstead1977elements}. 
 
2. Existing literature
  No previous studies have compared the readability of different programming languages. There are however existing papers that explore the concept of readability. \cite{buse2010learning} talks about readability and presents a metric system to automatically measure readability. \cite{posnett2011simpler} build on \cite{buse2010learning}'s concept to provide a simpler and more accessible metric system. \cite{hansen2013makes} focus on what makes code hard to read and presents those factors. 
 3. Why is it important?
\cite{aggarwal2002integrated} talks about code maintainability and mentions readability as a factor related to maintainability. 

\cite{elshoff1982improving} also talks about readability and how it impacts maintainability. \cite{elshoff1982improving} brings up specific coding standards/conventions/practices to show differences in readability. 


\textbf{Industry}: To compare code of different language to be able to prioritize them. \\
Further studies can be conducted to see if there is a correlation between popularity of projects and the readability of the langauage(s) used in the project. \\
\textbf{Academia}: To conduct more studies on the area which compare different languages. \\
To determine which languages are most suited for academic teaching. (When other attributes of programming languages are not constraints).
