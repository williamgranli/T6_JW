​\Section{Introduction}
*5 references must be used to support claims in Introduction
Use parts of Abstract and Intro from CM. 
\SubSection{Problem Statement}
Take this from CM. 
How do large companies implement changes in environments which are split by two programming paradigms? 

\SubSection{Existing Literature}
Use parts of the CM report. 
Most relevant is probably Jani's but could find stuff in the other's too. 

\SubSection{Motivation for Research}
Academia: Has not been done before. (I.e. all CM papers talk about implementing something in a homogenous environment). 
Industry: It's useful to Ericsson. They have had problems implementing changes and keeping up with the competition. It might be good to look up other companies which use MDSD and make a case for them as well. 

\Section{Purpose of the Study}
It's an exploratory study. We want to find out how CM is done in such environemnts, if it's successful and how it can be improved. 

\SubSection{Research Question(s)}
RQ: How is change managed in a company which has a split development strategy (e.g. mdsd+manual)?
SRQ1: How can it be done better blabla?
SRQ2: etc. 

\Section{Case Company Description}
TBA

\Section{Methodology}
We aim to conduct an exploratory study. ("finding out what is happening, seeking new insights and generating ideas
and hypotheses for new research.", runesson host)

Data Triangulation:
Data (source) triangulation—using more than one data source or collecting the same
data at different occasions.
Observer triangulation—using more than one observer in the study.
Methodological triangulation—combining different types of data collection methods,
e.g. qualitative and quantitative methods.
Theory triangulation—using alternative theories or viewpoints.

The design will be flexible based on the data collected (runesson host). 
	Come up with examples on how x data can affect the study. 


Why case study? 
Case studies offer an approach which does not need a strict boundary between the studied object and its environment; perhaps the key to understanding is in the interaction between the two? (runesson host)

Steps\&Phases
1. Case study design: Objectives are defined and the case study is planned. 

\begin{itemize}
\item Describe and explain the research strategy (i.e. case study)
\item Describe and explain the investigation methods that will be used
\item Motivate the choice of case study using relevant references
\item Describe the data collection procedures, sampling method(s), number of subjects etc.
\item Describe the subjects and how they were selected
\item Create questions for your interviews (include the questions in your report)
\item Describe and motivate the method for analyzing the data
\item Discuss validity threats
\end{itemize}

\Section{References}
Make real ref list later


\Section{Acknowledgements}
Write who did what
