â€‹\Section{Introduction}
Ever since the first computer programs were written, researchers and developers have been working on new programming concepts in order to decrease the level of complexity needed to develop programs. The abstraction level has been increased with help of compilers, object-oriented programming and Unified Modelling Language (UML). The current trend within software engineering (SE) is Model-driven Software Development (MDSD) which uses UML to generate object-oriented code \cite{staron2006adopting}. 

The benefits of MDSD have consistently been reported in academia \cite{staron2006adopting} \cite{volter2013model}. Many large companies such as Ericsson and ABB \cite{staron2006adopting} also use MDSD as a part of their development chain. In industry, however, MDSD struggles to make a (full) (x-wide) (XXX) breakthrough and it is mostly used for niche systems such as embedded and safety-critical systems.

\SubSection{Statement of the Problem}

The selection of development process, programming language and programming paradigm has a high impact on the development speed depending on what the the system requirements are and in which environment the system is developed. Selecting for example MDSD for the wrong system and setting may have a very negative impact on development speed, quality and maintainability. 



\SubSection{Existing Literature}

Volter et al\cite{volter2013model} says that successful adoption of MDSD should increase development speed, increase software quality, improve reusability and improve manageability through abstraction.

Whittle and Hutchinson \cite{whittle2012mismatches} conducted a study whereby they examined 17 companies who were adopting MDSD. While they agreed that the successful adoption of MDSD can improve productivity through code generation, there are many pitfalls which can cause the adoption to fail. Whittle and Hutchinson found that in companies where the change was implemented bottom up, there was a higher degree of success. On the contrary to this, when change was top down, as suggested by academia and education, the adoption was often not as successful. A focus on Domain Specific Languages (DSLs) is what Whittle and Hutchinson suggest helps MDSD become successful in a company setting.

A further, more specific example is a study conducted by Staron \cite{staron2006adopting}. In this study a case study is conducted with two companies wishing or in the process of adopting MDSD. In the findings, Staron provides a set of conditions for adopting MDSD, one being the compatibility of MDSD and existing principles in the company. Staron states that the adoption of this new process must be usable by the previous processes in place \cite{staron2006adopting}. He concludes by stating that this compatibility is especially important for larger companies due to the heavy effort required to implement the change. In a second study \cite{staron2008transitioning}, Staron provides possible reasons for the adoption of MDSD to fail. He suggests that the large investment in time and money, immature technology and organisational resistance are all factors to overcome in the adoption of new processes.

Mattsson et al. \cite{mattsson2009linking} discuss the correlation between MDSD and software architecture. The idea that MDSD is benefitial if done right is presented, and one important factor brought up is the need of automatic enforcment of architectural rules \cite{mattsson2009linking}. If this has to be done manually, it will become a bottleneck in large MDSD projects \cite{mattsson2009linking}.

\SubSection{Motivation for Study}

Academia appears to be united in the opinion that MDSD is an improvement compared with traditional software development \cite{staron2006adopting} \cite{volter2013model}. However, why then do most large software companies chose not to adopt MDSD?

This gap in the literature is the motivation for our study. There is therefore a need to methodically investigate the existing literature in which studies of the adoption of MDSD, advantages and disadvantages of MDSD are explored. Not only this but how and when should MDSD be adopted and how it can be ensured to succeed.

\SubSection{Research Questions}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{RQ1:} In which situations should companies expect that changing to MDSD would lead to positive effects? 
\item \textbf{RQ1.1:} In which domain(s) is MDSD the most successful? 
\item \textbf{RQ1.2:} Which software development process(es) has been most successfully used in conjunction with MDSD?
\item \textbf{RQ1.3:} What are the characteristics of the systems of the companies that successfully use MDSD?
\item \textbf{RQ1.4:} Which change strategy has most successful in implementing MDSD? 
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\item They are probably not worded optimally... Here're some alturnutuves:
\item In which situations should companies expect MDD to be successfully adopted?
\item In which situations should companies expect that the adoption of MDD would lead to a performance boost?
\end{itemize}


\Section{Methodology}

\begin{itemize}
\item Describe and explain the research strategy (i.e. SLR) and investigation methods that will be used for the study. 
\item Motivate your choice of experiment using relevant references. 
\item Search string including keywords and used databases
\item inclusion/exclusion criteria
\item data extraction
\item data synthesis
\item quality assessment
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Planning the review}
\begin{itemize}
\item Identification of the need for a review (5.1)
Check other SLRs in the field and evaluate them
\item Commissioning a review (5.2)
not needed
\item Specifying the research question(s) (5.3)
this is very important :)
the search process must identify primary studies that address the research questions
the data extraction process must extract the data items needed to answer the questions
the data analysis process must synthesise the data in such a way that the questions can be answered.

read the questions in 5.3.1 to come up with similar ones for readability

\item Developing a review protocol (5.4)

\item Evaluating the review protocol (5.5)
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Conducting the review}
\begin{itemize}
\item Identification of research (6.1)
\item Selection of primary studies (6.2)
\item Study quality assessment (6.3)
\item Data extraction and monitoring (6.4)
\item Data synthesis
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Reporting the review}
\begin{itemize}
\item Specifying dissemination mechanisms (7.1)
\item Formatting the main report (7.2)
\item Evaluating the report (7.3)
\end{itemize}
