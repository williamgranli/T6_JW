\Section{Methodology}
This section will describe which statistical tests were used, and why. The level of significance used for all tests is 5\%. 

\SubSection{Tests Used for H\textsubscript{eff} and H\textsubscript{rate}}
Initially, Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) Goodness-of-Fit and Shapiro-Wilks (SW) tests were used to determine if the assumption of normality could be held for the data set. The KS and SW tests both reported p-values < 0.05 and thus the null hypotheses of the data being normally distributed was rejected. See Table 1 for the results of the KS and SW tests. 

\begin{table}
	\centering
	\begin{tabular}[ht]{| l | l | l |}
	\hline
	Test & Sample & p-value  \\
	\hline
	KS & UC & =< 2.2e-16 \\
	\hline
	SW & UC & 0.000969 \\
	\hline
	KS & CL & =< 2.2e-16 \\
	\hline
	SW & CL & 0.309 \\	
	\hline
	\end{tabular}
	\caption{Results of normality tests}
\end{table}

A graphical representation of the level of normalisation can be seen in Figure 1 and 2. The results from the tests are supported by the sparseness of the data points.

The next step was to perform outlier test. The method used was boxplots. As seen in Figure 3 and 4, no outliers were detected and thus no data points were removed in the tests performed.

Since the data is non-normalised, the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney (WMW) two-sample rank-sum teset was chosen instead of the Student's T-test as the final test. The result of the WMW test was W=250, p=0.1063 and with the significance level of 89 (cite www.sussex) H0 is rejected. (Note that this was done on the raw data and not /45*60).

MWW = good for cont tests as well.

\Section{Tests for eff}

\verbatiminput{f_eff.txt}

Since the p-value is larger than 0.05, we can deduce that the variances are homogeneous (cite expe) and that the T-test is the optimal approach.

\verbatiminput{t_eff.txt}

According to the test, the efficiency of CL is 7.3 while the efficiency of UC is 6.16 and H0 eff is therefore rejected. 

\Section{Tests for rate}

\verbatiminput{f_rate.txt}



Since the p-value is larger than 0.05, we can deduce that the variances are homogeneous (cite expe) and that the T-test is the optimal approach.


\verbatiminput{t_rate.txt}

According to the test, the rate of CL is 1.45 while the effectiveness of UC is 0.12 and h0 rate is therefore rejected.

X-squared = 5.4847, df = 2, p-value = 0.06442

Since our significance level is 0.05 and p > 0.05, there is no significant difference and h1 is rejected.

Chi-square test requirements[edit]
Quantitative data.
One or more categories.
Independent observations.
Adequate sample size (at least 10).
Simple random sample.
Data in frequency form.
All observations must be used.
