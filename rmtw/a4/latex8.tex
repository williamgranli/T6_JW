​\Section{Introduction}
Software inspections have since its inception [1] more than
25 years ago spawned quite some interest both from the
research community and industrial practice. The research
includes changes to the inspection process, e.g. [2], support to
the process, e.g. [3] and empirical studies, e.g. [4]. The
suggested improvements include active design reviews [5] and
perspective-based reading [6]. Industry has studied the
benefits of conducting software inspections [7].
The objective of this study is to compare and hence
evaluate how well the use-case based reading performs in
comparison to other methods. The study presents a controlled
experiment where use-case based reading is compared to
checklist-based reading.
